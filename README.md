# Malware Classification with Machine Learning and NLP Techniques

This repository encompasses the implementation of five distinct machine learning algorithms designed for the task of malware classification. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization and vectorization, alongside feature selection methods like Chi-square, this work aims to advance the field of malware analysis.
